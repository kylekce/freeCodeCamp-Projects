            <p>
                Java is a popular programming language that was first released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems.
                It is an object-oriented language that is designed to be easy to use and maintain, with a
                focus on portability and security. Java is widely used for developing desktop, web, and
                mobile applications, as well as server-side applications and enterprise software.

                To get started with Java, you will need to download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your
                computer.
                The JDK includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which is required to run Java programs, as well as
                a number
                of development tools such as the Java compiler and debugger. Once you have installed the JDK, you can
                create
                and run Java programs using a text editor and the command-line tools provided by the JDK.

                Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program written in Java:
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>
                        public class HelloWorld {<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Hello, World!");<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                        }
                </code>
            </p>
