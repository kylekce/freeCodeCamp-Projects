            <p>
                Java is a popular programming language that was first released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems.
                It is an object-oriented language that is designed to be easy to use and maintain, with a
                focus on portability and security. Java is widely used for developing desktop, web, and
                mobile applications, as well as server-side applications and enterprise software.
            </p>

                To get started with Java, you will need to download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your
                computer.
                The JDK includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which is required to run Java programs, as well as
                a number
                of development tools such as the Java compiler and debugger. Once you have installed the JDK, you can
                create
                and run Java programs using a text editor and the command-line tools provided by the JDK.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program written in Java:
            </p>
            <code>
                public class HelloWorld {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Hello, World!");<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                }
             </code>
            <p>
                This program defines a class called HelloWorld with a single method main(), which prints the string
                "Hello, World!"
                to the console using the System.out.println() method. To compile and run this program, save it as a file
                named
                HelloWorld.java and run the following commands in a terminal:

            <p>
                Java code is organized into classes, which are composed of fields and methods. Java has eight primitive
                data types:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>byte</li>
                <li>short</li>
                <li>int</li>
                <li>long</li>
                <li>float</li>
                <li>double</li>
                <li>char</li>
                <li>boolean</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here's an example code snippet in Java that demonstrates primitive data types:</p>
            <code>
                public class PrimitiveDataTypesExample {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;byte b = 100;<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short s = 1000;<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int i = 100000;<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long l = 1000000000;<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float f = 1.2345f;<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double d = 1.23456789;<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char c = 'a';<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boolean b = true;<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
            }
            </code>
            <p>
                Java programs are executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which provides a secure and portable
                runtime environment.
                Java also includes features such as exceptions, generics, and annotations.

        <section id="object-oriented" class="main-section">
            <header>Object-Oriented Programming in Java</header>
            <p>
                Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it supports the concepts of classes
                and objects.
                A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class. Java also
                supports inheritance,
                which allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's an example of a class hierarchy in Java:
            </p>
            <code>
                class Animal {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void eat() {<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("I am eating");<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                }<br>
                <br>
                class Dog extends Animal {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void bark() {<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Woof!");<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                }<br>
                <br>
                class Cat extends Animal {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void meow() {<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Meow!");<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                }                
            </code>
            <p>
                In this example, the Animal class defines a single method eat(),
                while the Dog and Cat classes inherit from Animal and define their own methods bark() and meow().

            <header>Java Libraries and Frameworks</header>
            <p>
                Java has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to develop complex applications
                quickly.
                Some popular Java libraries and frameworks include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spring Framework: A popular framework for building enterprise applications, which provides features
                    such as dependency injection, AOP, and web MVC.</li>
                <li>Hibernate: A library for working with databases in Java, which provides an object-relational mapping
                    (ORM) layer and other features such as caching and lazy loading.</li>
                <li>Apache Commons: A collection of reusable Java components, such as utilities for working with
                    strings, collections, and IO.</li>
                <li>JUnit: A popular testing framework for Java, which provides support for writing and running unit
                    tests.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Here's an example of how to use the Apache Commons IO library to read a file into a String in Java:
            </p>
            <code>
                import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;<br>
                <br>
                //...<br>
                <br>
                try {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;String fileContent = FileUtils.readFileToString(new File("example.txt"), "UTF-8");<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(fileContent);<br>
                } catch (IOException e) {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.printStackTrace();<br>
                }

                Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA are integrated development environments (IDEs) that provide a complete
                development environment for Java.
                They include features such as code completion, debugging, and refactoring. Apache Maven and Gradle are
                build tools that automate
                the building and deployment of Java applications. They can manage dependencies, run tests, and create
                executable JAR files.

            <header>Java Best Practices</header>
            <p>
                Here are some best practices to keep in mind when writing Java code:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, methods, and classes</li>
                <li>Follow a consistent naming convention (e.g. camelCase or snake_case)</li>
                <li>Use proper indentation and formatting for readability</li>
                <li>Limit the scope of variables and methods to where they are needed</li>
                <li>Avoid using magic numbers and instead use constants or enums for clarity</li>
                <li>Use exception handling to gracefully handle errors and failures</li>
                <li>Avoid unnecessary or excessive comments, and instead write self-explanatory code</li>
                <li>Write unit tests to ensure the functionality of your code</li>
                <li>Regularly review and refactor your code to improve readability, maintainability, and efficiency.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Here's an example of using the try-with-resources statement in Java, which is a best practice for
                working with resources
                that need to be closed after use (such as file streams or database connections):
            </p>
            <code>
                try (FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("example.txt")) {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fileWriter.write("Hello, world!");<br>
                } catch (IOException e) {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.err.println("Error writing to file: " + e.getMessage());<br>
                }
            </code>
            <p>
                In this example, the FileWriter resource is opened inside the try statement and closed automatically at
                the end of the block, even if an exception is thrown.
                This eliminates the need for a finally block to close the resource manually, which can help make the
                code cleaner and less error-prone.
            </p>
            <p>
                By following these best practices, you can write clean, efficient, and maintainable code in Java.
