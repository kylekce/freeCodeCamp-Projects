            <p>
                Java is a popular programming language that was first released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems.
                It is an object-oriented language that is designed to be easy to use and maintain, with a
                focus on portability and security. Java is widely used for developing desktop, web, and
                mobile applications, as well as server-side applications and enterprise software.

                To get started with Java, you will need to download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your
                computer.
                The JDK includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which is required to run Java programs, as well as
                a number
                of development tools such as the Java compiler and debugger. Once you have installed the JDK, you can
                create
                and run Java programs using a text editor and the command-line tools provided by the JDK.

                Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program written in Java:
            </p>
            <code>
                public class HelloWorld {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Hello, World!");<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                }
             </code>
            <p>
                This program defines a class called HelloWorld with a single method main(), which prints the string
                "Hello, World!"
                to the console using the System.out.println() method. To compile and run this program, save it as a file
                named
                HelloWorld.java and run the following commands in a terminal:
            </p>

            <p>
                Java code is organized into classes, which are composed of fields and methods. Java has eight primitive
                data types:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>byte</li>
                <li>short</li>
                <li>int</li>
                <li>long</li>
                <li>float</li>
                <li>double</li>
                <li>char</li>
                <li>boolean</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Java programs are executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which provides a secure and portable
                runtime environment.
                Java also includes features such as exceptions, generics, and annotations.

            <p>
                Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it supports the concepts of classes
                and objects.
                A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class. Java also
                supports inheritance,
                which allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
            </p>

                Here's an example of a class hierarchy in Java:
